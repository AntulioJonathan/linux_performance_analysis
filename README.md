linux_performance_analysis
==========================

This is a subset of tools and dashboards for Linux Performance Analysis for each kernel release. 

The idea of this project is to create a public web page where all patches of the linux kernel next branch ( still not merged on the linux kernel ) could be tested with some basic perfomance tools. 

Basic set of tools (http://www.brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html): 

This page links to various Linux performance material I've created, including the tools maps on the right. These show: Linux observability tools, Linux benchmarking tools, Linux tuning tools, and Linux sar. For more diagrams, see my slide decks below.
Tools

    perf_events: perf one-liners, examples, visualizations.
    perf-tools: perf analysis tools using perf_events and ftrace (github).
    ktap: one-liners, examples, and scripts.
    Flame Graphs: using perf, SystemTap, and ktap.
